= pulseIn()


// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS
[#overview]

[float]
=== Description
Reads a pulse (either HIGH or LOW) on a pin. For example, if *value* is *HIGH*, `pulseIn()` waits for the pin to go *HIGH*, starts timing, then waits for the pin to go *LOW* and stops timing. Returns the length of the pulse in microseconds. Gives up and returns 0 if no pulse starts within a specified time out.

The timing of this function has been determined empirically and will probably show errors in longer pulses. Works on pulses from 10 microseconds to 3 minutes in length.

[float]
=== Syntax
`pulseIn(pin, value)`

`pulseIn(pin, value, timeout)`

[float]
=== Parameters
`pin`: the number of the pin on which you want to read the pulse. (int)

`value`: type of pulse to read: either link:../../../variables/constants/constants/[HIGH] or link:../../../variables/constants/constants/[LOW]. (int)

`timeout` (optional): the number of microseconds to wait for the pulse to start; default is one second (unsigned long)
[float]
=== Returns
the length of the pulse (in microseconds) or 0 if no pulse started before the timeout (unsigned long)

The example calculated the time duration of a pulse on pin 7.

int pin = 7;
unsigned long duration;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(pin, INPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  duration = pulseIn(pin, HIGH);
