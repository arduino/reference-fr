= digitalWrite()


// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS

[float]
=== Description
Write a `HIGH` or a `LOW` value to a digital pin.

If the pin has been configured as an `OUTPUT` with `pinMode()`, its voltage will be set to the corresponding value: 5V (or 3.3V on 3.3V boards) for `HIGH`, 0V (ground) for `LOW`.
[%hardbreaks]

If the pin is configured as an `INPUT`, `digitalWrite()` will enable (`HIGH`) or disable (`LOW`) the internal pullup on the input pin. It is recommended to set the `pinMode()` to `INPUT_PULLUP` to enable the internal pull-up resistor. See the digital pins tutorial for more information.
[%hardbreaks]

If you do not set the `pinMode()` to `OUTPUT`, and connect an LED to a pin, when calling `digitalWrite(HIGH)`, the LED may appear dim. Without explicitly setting `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()` will have enabled the internal pull-up resistor, which acts like a large current-limiting resistor.

[float]
=== Syntax
`digitalWrite(pin, value)`


[float]
=== Parameters
`pin`: the pin number

`value`: `HIGH` or `LOW`

[float]
=== Returns

[float]
=== Example Code
// Describe what the example code is all about and add relevant code   ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY ◄◄◄◄◄
The code makes the digital pin 13 an `OUTPUT` and toggles it by alternating between `HIGH` and `LOW` at one second pace.

//[source,arduino]
----
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);          // sets the digital pin 13 as output
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);       // sets the digital pin 13 on
  delay(1000);                  // waits for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);        // sets the digital pin 13 off
  delay(1000);                  // waits for a second
}

=== Notes and Warnings
The analog input pins can be used as digital pins, referred to as A0, A1, etc.
